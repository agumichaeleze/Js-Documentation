            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

              <h2 id="while statement">While statement</h2>
              <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
              <p class="statement">while (condition) statement</p>
              <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>
              <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
              <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
              <p class="statement">var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n  3) { n++; x += n; }</p>
              <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
              </ul>
